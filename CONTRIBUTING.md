# Contributing to QuantomDocs

First off, thank you for considering contributing to QuantomDocs! It's people like you that make QuantomDocs such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make one](https://github.com/your-repo/quantom-docs/issues/new)! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

### Fork & create a branch

If you decide to fix a bug or implement a feature, make sure to check out the master branch and make your changes in a separate branch. This makes it easier to review and merge your changes.

# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantom-docs.git
cd quantom-docs

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

### Code Style

Please try to follow the existing code style. The project uses a mix of Vanilla JavaScript and Node.js for the backend, and Python for some scripts.

- Use Prettier or a similar tool to format your JavaScript code.
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code.
